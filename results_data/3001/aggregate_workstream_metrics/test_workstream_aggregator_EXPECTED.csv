 Computation procedure is:
1. For a given fiscal year, we sum up the numerical targets across 3 W1 FO indicators * ~8 growth products (~24 numbers added). This is the denominator
2. For the same fiscal year, we measure what the actuals are for these indicators, and add them up (~24 numbers added). This is the numerator

2. A given milestone M will map to some Aha epics E1, E2,, En defining the scope of M. 
3. Each epic Ei has particular delivery date Ti. 
4. For a given quarter Q, we define the metric by looking at the subset E_Q of {E1, ...., En} that were initially committed for delivery in Q.
